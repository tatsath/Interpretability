            "1. Stocks: Stocks are ownership shares of a company that issue them. They represent a claim on the company's future earnings and assets. Investors purchase stocks with the intention of reselling them in the future at a higher price, with the hope of generating profit.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Bonds: Bonds are loans that companies or governments make to investors in exchange for a periodic interest payment and the repayment of the principal amount at maturity. Investors purchase bonds to secure a return on their investment.\n",

            "3. Derivatives: Derivatives are financial contracts that derive their value from an underlying asset, such as stocks, bonds, or currencies. Derivatives are used to manage risk, hedge against market movements, and potentially earn profit.\n",

            "4. Options: Options are contracts that give an investor the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a specified price within a specific timeframe. Options are used for hedging, speculation, and trading.\n",

            "5. Mutual funds and Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs): Mutual funds are diversified investments that pool money from multiple investors to purchase a specific basket of securities or assets. ETFs are similar to mutual funds but are traded on stock exchanges, allowing individual investors to invest in a diversified portfolio.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. Currency pairs: Currency pairs are pairs of currencies traded together, such as the US Dollar (USD) and the Euro (EUR). Investors can trade currency pairs for various reasons, including hedging against currency fluctuations, trading for speculative gains, or arbitrage opportunities.\n",
            "\n",

            "8. Derivatives backed by credit default swaps: Derivatives backed by credit default swaps are contracts that contract the creditworthiness of a corporation or government. The contract requires the issuer to repay the principal amount if the counterparty defaults on the obligation.\n",
